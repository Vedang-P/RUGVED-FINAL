# ðŸ§Š Task 7: Creating a Point Cloud & Performing Object Detection

In this task, youâ€™ll work with RGB and Depth images to reconstruct a 3D **point cloud** and then run **object detection** on that point cloud using the `Open3D` library.

This bridges the gap between traditional 2D computer vision and real-world spatial perception â€” a crucial skill in autonomous systems, AR/VR, and robotics.
