# 🧠 Task 6: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning Techniques

This task introduces two main areas of Machine Learning: **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning. You’ll be implementing clustering and classification algorithms using standard libraries — no need to code them from scratch. You’ll also be studying a set of foundational ML techniques in both categories.
