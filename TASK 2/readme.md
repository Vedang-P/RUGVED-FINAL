## 📌 Objectives

1. **Linear Regression**  
   - Implement a simple linear regression model  
   - Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., R², MSE)

2. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Study the theoretical foundation  
   - Understand its application in binary classification  
   - (Optional) Try implementing it on a suitable dataset

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understand the dataset’s structure, distributions, and key relationships  
   - Create visualizations to support insights and hypotheses
