# Task 1: Foundations with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and OpenCV

This task is focused on getting comfortable with essential Python libraries used in data science and computer vision. You'll explore:
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for plotting
- **OpenCV** for basic image handling

---

## 📚 Objective

Learn the basics of the above libraries and solve a series of questions using:
- `matches.csv`
- `deliveries.csv`
- An image file (`task1_questions.jpeg`) containing the problem prompts
